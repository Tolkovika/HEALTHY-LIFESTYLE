    <h2>Sleep</h2>
    <p>Rest is essential for a healthy mind and body.
        Prioritize 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night by maintaining a consistent bedtime routine and creating a
        calming sleep environment.
        Reduce screen time before bed, keep your room dark and cool, and avoid caffeine in the evening.
        Proper sleep helps you recharge and perform your best every day. </p>
